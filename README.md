DIY_digital_microscope
======================

Make your own digital microscope
Refer to the follwing instrictable for the hardware model http://www.instructables.com/id/Low-cost-digital-microscope-with-automated-slide-m/ 
If you have a simple student microscope, no worries! buy a couple of motors and that's it, you are good to go
IF you need higher precison with stepping stepper motors and opt to use pololu driver for 4micron precison.
The algorithm reamins the same, you need to check for your timing of steps (in specifc need to modify the dealy value)
